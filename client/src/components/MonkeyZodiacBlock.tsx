                    <p>The inquisitive mind stretches beyond itself, diving into deep waters without consequence.</p>
                    <p>I once got poison oak around the age of 8, exploring every berry and leaf in our new forest, our new country living, naive to consequence of swollen eyes.</p>
                    <p>Explore the universe, research, dive deep until the answers reveal themselves with the deepest of understanding.</p>
                    <p>Adobe - Photoshop - my most passionate darkroom in black box. The tools are so effective, efficient and transparency is a breeze, my favorite inspiration.</p>

                    <p>Mastering the arts of graphic and web design techniques, and a backstage photographic innate lust to create describes career passion...</p>
                    <p>Printmaking - another strong interest led to the graphic field from influences of Mucha...</p>
                    <p>Growth - application developer, data analyst, media developer, pattern identifier and people behavior observer...</p>
                    <p>Clever illustration of good humor. Twist a pun to memorialize the concept.</p>
                    <p>This site is a blend of my personal goals, artistic creatives and career relevant information. It is not a blog but an evolution of oneâ€™s spirit.</p>
